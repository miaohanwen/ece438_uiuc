# Repository for ECE/CS 438: Communication Networks
### Fall 2018 w/ Professor Romit Roy Chodhury

## Course Description

This course will introduce students to the key concepts underlying wired and wireless networking. The layered architecture of the network protocol stack will be the focus of discussion. Alongside, a variety of case studies will be drawn from the Internet, combined with practical programming exercises. At the end of the semester, students will well understand several concepts, including the Internet architecture, HTTP, DNS, P2P, Sockets, TCP/IP, BGP, Routing protocols, 
wireless and sensor networking, WiFi, cellular and satellite networks, security, etc.
